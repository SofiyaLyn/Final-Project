# Final-Project

*The analysis is based on dataset, 
which originally was created to discover the causality between import demand of the USA and
industrial production in Thailand*

The data covers information from 1998 to 2018 and also has three additionally pooled time series about the industrial production of Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines

**For this Final Project I used *asia-industry* dataset and perform analysis on both Stata and Python (*on The Jupyter Notebook platform*)**
